## **User roles and their descriptions**


**Admin**
Below are the admin privileges;


1. Edit, Delete, and Add New Data
Admins have full control over the platform's data. They can add new content such as restaurants and photos, keeping the platform updated. In addition, they can edit or remove outdated or incorrect data, ensuring the information on the platform is always accurate and relevant.


2. View All User Data
Admins have access to the complete set of user data, including profiles, activity logs, and reviews. This allows them to monitor user interactions, track engagement, and ensure compliance with the platforms guidelines. We can use this data for future modeling implementation.


3. Modify Customer Reviews
Admins can edit and remove customer reviews. By managing customer reviews, admins help maintain a constructive and informative environment for all users.

4. Access and Modify Internal Data Formats
Admins can work directly with the platforms underlying data structures, such as JSON and XML files. This ability allows them to modify how data is stored, transferred, and displayed, ensuring smooth functionality and integration with backend systems. This technical capability is essential for optimizing performance and implementing new features.

Registered users have access to personalized features, allowing them to save their favorite restaurants, create a wishlist of places, and leave reviews to share their thoughts with others. They can see a customized navigation bar that includes these interactive options.
