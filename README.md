2. View All User Data
   Admins have access to the complete set of user data, including profiles, activity logs, and reviews. This allows them to monitor user interactions, track engagement, and ensure compliance with the platforms guidelines. We can use this data for future modeling implementation.

   Admins can work directly with the platforms underlying data structures, such as JSON and XML files. This ability allows them to modify how data is stored, transferred, and displayed, ensuring smooth functionality and integration with backend systems. This technical capability is essential for optimizing performance and implementing new features.
